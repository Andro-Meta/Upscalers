# Upscalers
Upscalers Converted from .pth to .bin from https://openmodeldb.info
This conversion allows you to use these upscalers with Upscayl or in Deforum.

None of these Upscalers were created by me, this is just a collection of faves that I use for upscaling. The file names are the same as I found them, so look them up on OpenModelDB.info for more information about what each model does, or roll the dice.

For use with Upscayl, add into a folder labeled 'models' and direct upscayl to that folder in settings.

For use in Deforum, head to your Automatic 1111 webui\models\Deforum\realesrgan_ncnn\models folder and add these.

Link to upscalers coming soon, since they are just a little too large to fit on GitHub.
